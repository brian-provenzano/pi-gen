# Example sample config file to use for a basic k3s node
#
# Build can be run in VM - make sure to use a 32bit Ubuntu 18.04LTS VM and have the needed pkg prereqs installed on the build VM
# See Troubleshooting in README.md for details (basically make sure 'qemu-user-static' is installed)
#
# Usages / Getting Started :
# 1. cp this to create a new file called 'config' in the root of the repo and mod as needed.  !! Remove all the comments. !!
#    Use this as your config.  The build.sh script will uses this to customize your image.
# 2. sudo ./build.sh to start the build.  The image zip will be placed in the /deploy directory.
#    Use balenaEtcher to flash the image to sdcard and boot the Pi off it.  Pi should be available on the IP
#    you specified in the config.  user: pi  password: raspberry
# 3. Once booted, you can use k3sup or the k3s installer directly on the pi to install k3s.
# 4. You may wish to repeat for each node to build an image per node that is fully configured and ready for k3s.
#    If you decide to do this, take advantage of the config overrides function of the pi-gen build process by doing the following:
#    1. Setup your original config as noted above for the master node.
#    2. Create another config that overrides values for the worker or workers named "worker1config".  e.g. Override IMG_NAME, IP related vars, and HOSTNAME.
#       Example:
#       IMG_NAME="k3sNodeWorker1"
#       ETH0_IPADDRESS="10.0.0.201/24"
#       ETH0_GATEWAY="10.0.0.1"
#       ETH0_DNS="1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8"
#       WLAN_IPADDRESS="10.0.0.201/24"
#       WLAN_GATEWAY="10.0.0.1"
#       WLAN_DNS="1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8"
#       HOSTNAME="k3s-worker1"
#    3. Run all the builds at once - this will build 2 images: one for master and one for a worker.  Extend this to do more worker nodes if needed.
#       sudo ./build.sh && sudo ./build.sh -c worker1config
#
#
## USING K3SUP TO INSTALL K3S ON THE NODES: https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup
# 1. Server:
# ssh-copy-id pi@10.0.0.200 && k3sup install --ip 10.0.0.200 --user pi --context pi4-k3s --local-path ~/k3s-kubeconfig
#
# 2. Add agent/worker(s):
# k3sup join --ip 10.0.0.201 --server-ip 10.0.0.200 --user pi
#
## NOTES:
# modded the build.sh script to expect the vars noted below in the second section (this means careful mergin when pulling from upstream :()
# BUT was the easiest for now.  Will revisit)
# Sets some static IPs on various interfaces. See stagek8s/06-network-static/00-run.sh for details.
